Adds magazines to the game like wuut_magazines, but optimized for compatibility and redone from the ground up.

If you have used wuut_mags, this should feel pretty much the same. There are no changes in functionality.

Some new features compared to wuut_mags:
+ Unjamming is simplified. Now it just plays the unjam animation.
+ Expanded loadouts, combat backpack adds some magazine slots. Support for attachments to add mag slots if needed.
+ Traders sell a fixed amount of mags, replenishing with stock.
+ NPC mag drops overhauled. NPCs drop a variable amount of mags that are filled to a random amount.
+ Ammo wheel is cooler now
+ Mags show in your HUD!

Obviously this is not compatible with wuut_mags or other magazine mods. However we have incorporated a lot of quality of life tweaks:

+ Magazines automatically eject when upgrading or replacing parts
+ Mags are highlighted and ready mags are at the top of your inventory
+ Traders and NPCs have more realistic magazine loadouts
+ Quick release retains vested mags
+ New game gives you free magazines.
+ Weapons show if they have a magazine loaded or not.
+ Arena gives you loaded mags.
